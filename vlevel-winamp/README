Hi Markus,
For now you can stick stuff here, and include things using relative paths.
At some point, I should probably organize the tree better.  I'm thinking volumeleveler including the core class, with directories for each user (vlevel-bin, vlevel-ladspa, vlevel-winamp).  Commandline is a class I made to handle long options more C++'y than getopt_long, in case you're wondering.
